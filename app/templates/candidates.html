<!-- With $resource -->
<ul class="books">
  <li class="panel" ng-repeat="candidate in ctrl.candidates">
    {{ candidate.name }}
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- With $http

Note the extra 'books.data', which is needed because $resource does fancy promise resolution
when attached to a controller scope

<ul class="books">
  <li class="panel" ng-repeat="book in books.data">
    {{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }}
  </li>
</ul>
 -->
